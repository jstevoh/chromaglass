# Plan: a plate with real detail, and a show you can render

Two threads of work, merged into one running order.

**The look.** Filmed liquid (acrylic pour, oil and milk macro) carries structure at
every scale. Ours does not: measured on a 512 px centre crop, the reference frames
put 4.2–7.3 % of their pixels on a hard edge with a typical local contrast of 2–7,
while our settled Fillmore plate manages 2.4 % and 0.8. At the scales that read on a
wall (4–8 px) the reference carries three to five times more structure. The cause is
numerical diffusion: every solver step advects and diffuses the dye, so anything
finer than about eight cells is gone within a second, and nothing generates structure
below the grid.

**The instrument.** The show can be played from the music more directly than
sound-drive-and-hope, and a finished song deserves a rendered film rather than a
screen capture.

| Measure (512 px centre crop) | Pour | Drops | Marbling | Ours now |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pixels on a hard edge | 7.3 % | 4.2 % | 5.6 % | 2.4 % |
| Typical local contrast | 7.2 | 2.0 | 6.5 | 0.8 |
| Structure at 4 px | 1.5 % | 0.9 % | 1.3 % | 0.3 % |
| Structure at 8 px | 2.3 % | 2.2 % | 2.5 % | 0.5 % |

`npm run detail` (`scripts/detail.mjs`) produces this table, so every batch is judged
the same way rather than by eye.

## Running order

Each batch is one PR: build, test in the sandbox, merge, deploy, then a GPU look on
the Mac before the next one starts. Order is by what lifts everything else first,
and by what would otherwise force a rebase later.

### 1. Sharp liquid, and pigment in it

`src/lib/gpuFluid.ts`, `src/components/LiquidVisualizer.tsx`, `src/types.ts`

- **Interface sharpening** (`sharpness`, 0–1). A counter-diffusion term along the dye
  gradient, applied each step after advection, that restores the step at a boundary
  instead of letting it smear. This is how multiphase solvers keep two fluids apart.
  Clamped so it can only undo diffusion, never amplify beyond the local range of the
  four cells it samples, which is what stops checkerboarding.
- **Granulation** (`granulation`, `grainScale`). Sub-grid pigment texture: a noise
  field sampled in *advected* coordinates, so the speckle travels with the dye
  instead of sitting on the screen, modulated by dye thickness and by how slowly the
  cell is moving (pigment settles where the flow is slack).

Both land in the GPU and CPU solvers so the two engines still agree.

**Gate:** typical local contrast ≥ 3.0 and structure at 4 px ≥ 0.9 % on the Fillmore
frame at the preset's default, with no more than 15 % frame-time cost at 512², and no
oscillation over a 100 s settle. **Risk:** sharpening concentrates dye, so the budget
regulator will bite sooner; recheck every preset's `dyeBudget` in the same PR.
**Fallback:** the settings default to 0, so a bad look is one slider away from the
current behaviour.

### 2. Lacing

`src/components/LiquidVisualizer.tsx` (fragment shader)

The pale hair-thin filaments that outline every colour boundary in a pour. Driven by
the strain rate at the interface (the velocity gradient projected along the dye
gradient, both already available in the shader when the velocity texture is bound),
not drawn as a fixed edge, so it thins where the boundary is stretched and thickens
where it folds. New setting `lacing`; the existing `macroLacing` stays as the macro
camera's own.

**Gate:** pixels on a hard edge ≥ 4.5 %. **Depends on** batch 1: lacing a smeared
boundary looks like a glow, not a filament.

### 3. Drops, not rings

`src/lib/beads.ts`, the bead mask shader

The bead field is the right instinct and already measures well; take it three steps
further, to the second reference frame.

- Each drop carries **its own dye colour**, not just a dark rim.
- **Domed** body with one specular highlight, sized from the lamp's direction.
- **Polygonal flattening** when drops crowd, the way foam packs, instead of staying
  circles that push apart.
- **Compound drops**: a drop that has swallowed a smaller one keeps it visible.

New setting `beadDrops` (0–1) blends from today's dark-rimmed rings to full drops, so
the Fillmore look is unchanged at 0.

**Gate:** on a 2× crop, a 6:1 size range within one cluster, visible highlights, and
flattened contacts between touching drops.

### 4. Liquids that behave differently

`src/types.ts` (`LiquidType` grows behaviour fields), `src/components/LiquidVisualizer.tsx`

Today a liquid is an inject radius, an amount and a heat. Make the liquid kind change
the interface physics:

- **Soap.** Dropping it collapses the surface tension in a disc for a moment, so the
  colour flees outward and then curls into filaments. A real gesture from the era and
  the most performable thing in this batch; it wants a MIDI action and an OSC address
  like the press.
- **Milk.** An opaque, scattering ground that colour rides on top of rather than
  mixes into. Needs an opacity channel in the render rather than pure transmission,
  which is what makes the reference's reds sit so solid under the drops.
- **Silicone.** The cell maker: displaces colour aside into a ring rather than
  colouring it, which is where every cell in a pour comes from. Pairs with batch 3.
- **Glycerine.** Coils and ropes when poured, slow and thick.

**Depends on** batches 1 and 3 to read properly.

### 5. Playing it: sound learn, shutter, and a look link

`src/lib/soundLearn.ts` (new), `src/hooks/useAudioAnalyzer.ts`, `src/components/MidiPanel.tsx`,
`src/lib/cameraPass.ts`, `src/App.tsx`

Independent of batches 1–4, so it can be built while the Mac is judging a look, and it
is the batch that changes how the show feels to play.

**Sound learn.** Today the music drives three fixed things: sound drive, beat squeeze
and macro sync. Anything else is a hand on a knob. The reference tool does better than
that with two kinds of row: a *mapping* (source → target × depth, where the source is a
frequency band, the overall level or a drum) and a *trigger* (a one-shot on an onset:
a flash, a zoom punch, the next preset).

The better version of that reuses a vocabulary the app already has rather than adding
a second one. The Learn button that binds a control to a MIDI knob grows a second
source: the music. Pick a slider, pick kick, bass, snare, hats, level or a band, set a
depth, and the plate follows it. Triggers map onsets onto the existing `MidiAction`
list, so a kick presses the big dish into a sunburst, a snare drops the lead dye, a bar
line steps the preset. One learn flow, one action list, one set of bindings saved in
the same file, whether the hand on the control is yours, a fader's or the drummer's.

Ours can be better than a plain FFT for a reason they cannot match: the beat clock
predicts the next beat and the song map knows bars and sections, so a trigger fires
*on* the beat rather than a few tens of milliseconds behind the microphone. A
band-energy mapping still follows the sound directly; it is the discrete hits that get
to arrive on time.

Needs per-band energies and per-band onsets added to `useAudioAnalyzer` (it exposes
bass, mid, treble, energy and the raw `frequencyData` today, but no named bands and no
onsets).

**Shutter** (`shutter`, camera pass). Their trail buffer is a generic VJ smear laid
over everything. Here it belongs in the camera, where it is physically motivated: the
photographs that the Photograph style is built from are long exposures, and their light
trails and motion blur are part of why they read as film rather than as a screen. An
exposure-time control accumulates frames into the camera's existing scene buffer with a
decay, which puts it downstream of aperture and bloom so the three couple the way a
real lens does. Off in the light-show style, on by default in the Photograph presets.

**Look link.** The whole settings state in a URL. Preset files already do this properly
for a look you want to keep; a link is for the other case, showing someone a look right
now, between the laptop, the phone and anyone you want to send it to. Opening one sets
the look only: the projector window, the remote and the show server are untouched.

### 6. Render a song

`src/lib/rng.ts` (new), `src/lib/render.ts` (new), `src/hooks/useRecorder.ts`,
`src/lib/songMap.ts`, `src/lib/sequencer.ts`

This is the batch that changes what ChromaGlass is.

Recording today is `MediaRecorder` on the canvas: it captures whatever reached the
screen, drops frames whenever the machine is busy, and gives back a WebM whose timing
follows the render loop's bad luck. The reference tool does the opposite and is right
to: it steps the effect frame by frame, pre-analyses the loaded audio with an offline
FFT so the reactivity is identical on every run, encodes with WebCodecs and muxes to
MP4 with the audio track, up to 4K and ten minutes, streaming to disk rather than
holding the clip in memory.

We can go past that, because we have the pieces it has no equivalent for: song
identification, song maps, presets saved for a song and sequences with cue sheets. A
**Render this song** that plays the sequence deterministically, at a grid the live
machine cannot hold (768² or 1024²), with every solver step computed rather than every
displayed frame captured, produces a finished light-show film of that song. Not a
screen recording of a performance: the performance itself, run again at full quality.
Nobody else in this space ships that.

- **Seeded randomness.** There are 104 `Math.random` calls in the solver, the beads,
  the bubbles and the macro camera. Every one becomes a draw from a seeded generator
  carried on the fluid, or the same song rendered twice is two different films. This is
  the bulk of the work.
- **Offline audio analysis.** Bands and onsets pre-computed per frame from the song
  file, so the reactivity is fixed to the timeline rather than to the frame rate, and a
  render at 60 fps matches a render at 30.
- **WebCodecs encode to MP4** with the audio track, streaming to disk. Chrome only; on
  other browsers the current `MediaRecorder` capture stays as the fallback and says so.
- **Runs the show, not the settings.** A sequence, a per-song preset and the cue sheet
  play out over the song's real timeline.

**Gate:** the same song rendered twice is byte-identical, and a 3-minute 1080p render
completes without dropping a frame.

## Not doing

- **Kaleidoscope, tiling, tunnel, halftone, posterize, solarize.** Warps of a picture.
  They are what every VJ tool already offers and they would erase the plate's identity.
- **A built-in drum machine.** Reacting to a synthesized beat is fine for rehearsal,
  but you perform with a band, and the music file player already covers practice.

## If you want to reorder

Two things decide the order above, and both can be moved.

- **Batches 5 and 6 are the ones that matter most**, and they sit last only because of
  a dependency, not because they are worth less: 6 changes what the app is, 5 changes
  how it feels to play. 5 touches no fluid code and can be pulled forward at any time.
- **The seeded generator is the hinge.** It is a mechanical sweep over 104 call sites
  in files that batches 1–4 also edit. Doing it last means one sweep over code that has
  just changed; doing it first means every later batch is written against the seeded
  generator from the start, which is cleaner but delays the first visible improvement
  and will shift existing bead layouts and finger spokes slightly. It is worth pulling
  forward as its own small PR the moment rendering a song is the next thing wanted.

## Operating rules

- The sandbox runs the CPU solver under SwiftShader, so every look is judged on the
  Mac's GPU before the next batch starts.
- One Mac session at a time, committing from a worktree, never while a show is
  running: two sessions in one checkout have already trodden on each other's server
  and files.
- Every new setting is MIDI-learnable, reachable from the phone, and defaults to the
  current behaviour so a preset made today still looks the same tomorrow.
