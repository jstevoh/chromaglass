# 11. The mixer

**Partly shipped**: the mixer is built and live (the stack, the lumia and gel rows, a blend per row, crossfades, the narrow desk, the Back that fully goes back, the remote's own check), and several Mac checks that went red are fixed. What is open is below: the Mac looks still owed, the row per projector, and the faults found along the way. How it was found, built and measured is in [`docs/plan-shipped.md`](docs/plan-shipped.md), under the same number.

`src/lib/mixer.ts`, `src/components/MixerPanel.tsx`, the display pass in
`src/gpu/wgsl/plate.ts`; the design is [docs/rig-plan.md](docs/rig-plan.md) R7.

Asked for directly on 2026-09-27: "a video mixer control available from the top level
but also in the settings, that can move the order of layers (LED spinning, video,
picture, any other image input) and control brightness, contrast and the other photo
and video standards on each." With it, a standing rule: every feature ships its phone
version in the same PR (see the operating rules below).

1. **The sources there are, in one stack**, *shipped* (#176). The LED ring, the front
   and back plates, the film and the logo, top of the list on top on the wall; the
   front plate fixed, and only the LED ring passing it (the lamp under the glass, or a
   beam over it). Each row has a level and a grade (brightness, contrast, saturation,
   hue). On the Perform desk (docked beside the plate, no scrim), in Settings → Mixer,
   on the phone's Mix sheet and on the remote; every control MIDI-learnable and
   pinnable, four pads to walk a source up the stack. At the defaults the picture is
   byte-identical to before. `npm run mixer` measures it (31 checks, each held red
   against a broken shader). **Owed:** the Mac look in `docs/judging.md` §13 (the film
   between the plates, the LED beam, whether 0–200 % is the right travel).
2. **The other pictures as rows**, *shipped* (#189). The lumia and the gel wheel
   were each still set in their own corner of Settings (the camera already comes in
   as the film). Each is now a row with its level (Lumia and Gel Wheel, the same
   settings) and its own grade. With the LED ring they are the lamp's three, the
   only rows that can go under the front plate, built bottom up into the light the
   glass is lit by; raised over it, the lumia is a beam screened over the plate and
   the gel a filter on the lens, which colours what is under it in the stack and
   leaves black glass black. Every order saved before keeps its picture (the two go
   in under the front plate, where the shader always drew them), and seven scenes
   rendered on main and on the change are the same to the byte. Two more pads
   (Mixer: Raise Gel Wheel, Raise Lumia). `npm run mixer` 44/44, each new check held
   red against a broken shader. **Owed:** the Mac look in `docs/judging.md` §13 (the
   gel's 1.5 gain over the lens; the lumia as a beam).
3. **A blend per row**, *shipped* (#193). Every row but the front plate keeps the
   way it always came in as Own (the beams screened, the gel a filter, the film
   through the dye, the logo by its alpha, the back plate by its Blend Mode) and can
   be set to Screen, Add, Multiply or Key instead, in its Grade drawer; a row off
   Own says which in its tag. R3's additive light made a choice. Everything starts
   on Own, and the seven scenes of step 2 render the same to the byte. Six pads
   (Mixer: Next Blend, per row). `npm run mixer` 60/60: each blend on each row,
   the lamp's three included, is its formula pixel by pixel (within 1 step of 255,
   the nearest other formula 4 to 42 steps away); the logo's clear margin stays
   clear; on paper the back plate is still lit as a photograph and blended after;
   the post chain's finish is told the logo's blend; and the checks were held red
   against seventeen broken shaders. Key keys at Film Key on the film and at its
   default elsewhere. `npm run phone` presses every row's blend and holds each
   row's name whole beside its tag. **Owed:** the Mac look in `docs/judging.md` §13
   (the key's edge on a real film; Add over a bright plate). The front plate has no
   blend: it is the glass the rest is laid on.
4. **Crossfade a row**, *shipped* (#195). Each row has a Fade button beside its level
   that takes it out over the row's fade time and brings it back to where it was (a
   film at 40% comes back at 40%); pressed while it runs, it turns round from where it
   is, in its share of the time; a fader moved during a fade stops it there. The fade
   time is in bars, in the row's drawer (0 to 8, 0 is a cut, two bars to start),
   counted at the tempo the desk sends or taps, else the one heard, else 120. Seven
   pads (Mixer: Fade In/Out, per row), each fade time MIDI-learnable; the desk,
   Settings, the phone's Mix sheet and the remote all have the buttons. `npm run
   rowfade` 48/48 drives whole fades at the show timer's 16 ms: no step past the
   curve's steepest (0.0024 on a four-second fade from 0.4), at rest at both ends,
   on time, the turn-round, the hand, the cut, a Go during a fade on every row, the tempo the bars
   are counted at, and the wiring; held red against twenty broken fades. A song's glide
   of a level, and a sequence stage's writes, stop a take on it, as a hand does; a
   new look forgets where its gel and lumia were taken out from; the remote's
   buttons light from the display's state. `npm run phone` presses the front plate's
   button on a phone and reads it walk to 0 in 3.8 s over 41 levels, turn round and
   come back. Found on the way and fixed here: a Go laid each step of its fade down
   whole, the room's settings as they were when it was pressed, so a film taken out
   (or a fader ridden) during a Go flickered back once a step; the look fade now
   keeps the room as it is (`keepRoom`), and a take on the gel or the lumia pressed during
   a Go, whose levels the look also sets, is the take's to the end of the Go (`lookStep`;
   the Go undid it, 63 steps back up, before). **Owed:** the Mac look in
   `docs/judging.md` §13, and a film coming in from a pad filmed by hand
   (`film.yml`) to show no hard cut in its motion table.
6. **A row per projector** (rig-plan R1). Once a rig has more than one live plate,
   each projector's plate is a row, with its own grade at the projector's scope (R2).
   This is the large one; it waits on R1, and is §16e.

Found while shipping step 2, not yet done: #189's deploy (main 41ad65e) went red on
the Mac show shard's `qa` at two checks that passed on the same tree in the PR's run an
hour before: "the plate, not the hole, takes the pointer" (the cursor over a DIV at the
desk's preview) and "the run completed" (`__cgFrame` returned null in the look-fade
colour section), with "requestAdapter did not answer in 10s" in the console. Neither
touches the Mixer; the second looks like the adapter going away under the run.
**Fixed (this PR):** `apart`, `luma`, `jumps`, `colour` and `throughTheHole` in `qa.mjs`
guard against `null` frames and missing adapter without throwing, reporting `no frame`
rather than aborting the suite with `the run completed`. And #193's first show shard died before any test ran: the runner could not
resolve github.com at checkout.

Found while shipping step 4, not yet done: #195's deploy (main 6c6d17e) went red on
two Mac checks that passed on the same tree in its PR run and again in #196's run
right after, so step 4 went live only with #196. `npm run ears` on the open shard:
"visible with the wall asking too" drew 14 frames in 2 s where it asks more than 20
(35 in #196's run); every reading was in the right place, so the floor counted the
runner's frame rate, not the ear, and the "Gaps in the plan" thread has a fix on #194.
`npm run squeeze` on the show shard: "the tapped beat drives the show's clock" read a
beat every 396.6 ms against 401.4 ms tapped (2 ms allowed), with the plate stepping
255 times in 12 s where it steps about 320; the Mixer's fades only read the tempo. The
tempo the taps set is the plain mean of their gaps, so something moved the clock off it
after the taps; worth reading whether the clock falls back to the heard beat when a
frame comes more than 250 ms after the last (`beatClock.setExternal`'s window).

Found while building step 4, and settled: step 4 made Back keep the room's settings
the hand changed after the Go (the film's level, the Mixer, the dimmer), since each
step of a look fade kept the room as it was. The owner asked for Back to go fully back
(2026-09-27), so it has its own path now, **done** (#204): a Back fades the wall's
part of the room back with the look (`backStep`), leaves the machine's setup
(`SETUP_KEYS`: the grid, the microphone's latency and prediction, the room camera's
reading, the set's pacing, the logo's place, each row's take time), anything a hand, a
pad or a song writes while the Back runs, and the dimmer in a blackout, and stops every
take still walking. `npm run rowfade` 48 → 58: a Go, the hand's moves after it and a
Back: film, dimmer, a row's grade and the microphone back as they were (all four stayed
put through the Go's step, the control), the look's 24 changed settings back, the setup
left, no tick more than a smooth two seconds allows, a ride and a blackout during the
Back held, a take stopped (left running, it walks the film to 0 under the Back), and
every writer of the wall's settings marked. The pre-push review found the blackout,
the Mixer's order and blend pads and a running glide written over by a Back, and the
check-skeptic eleven broken Backs that passed the first checks; all fixed and red
now. Still true: a Back after a new song's own look rewinds the room to when that
song began, which "fully back" means but may surprise after an unattended change.
Not done here: a take pressed during a Go wins over
the Go for that row, but a hand on the gel wheel's or the lumia's slider during a Go
still does not (the Go's next step puts the look's level back), and inside a sequence
a take on the gel or the lumia during a stage's glide is stopped by the glide's next
tick, as a hand's is (the button lights once and nothing moves). The rule a Go now
keeps (a later press wins, to the end of the change) would settle both.

Found while building step 3, not yet done: the logo darkens what is under it by up to
8 steps of 255 in the pixel or two where its card meets its clear margin, on its own
way in as much as any blend, because its texture is filtered with its colour not
premultiplied by its alpha (`npm run mixer` stays two pixels clear of that edge).
Premultiplying on upload would take it out. And once, in a cloud session,
`npm run phone`'s "spreading them zooms in by as much as they spread" read 4.00× →
5.60× (1.40 times, 3.40 wanted): the zoom followed the first of six finger moves
(50 → 70 px) and none after. It passed on the next run (3.40) and on every run before;
the Mix sheet is shut by then. Worth reading whether a touchMove can be dropped while
the page is busy. Seen again building step 4: three runs in seven with `PW_WEBGPU=1`
(1.40, 1.40, 3.00 times), on step 4's tree and once on step 3's. Sending the move the
pinch's once-a-frame throttle holds back when the frame is up, instead of at the lift,
did not stop it, so the later moves seem not to reach the pinch at all (inferred, not
measured): the touch listeners' cleanup drops the pinch, and a plate rebuilt mid-pinch
would do exactly this.

Three Mac checks went red once each on commits that did not touch them, one per run,
while this batch's plan was going in (#177), and no cause is known yet:

- `npm run phone`, "two fingers holding Drop lay dye under both": A 62 against B
  181, 0.34 of each other where the check asks 0.4 (0.63–0.99 over the nine other
  runs that have it). Not the plate coasting: the line now prints how far the
  fingers' cells moved between picking and holding, and it read 0.0 on the next
  run. Look next at the held Drop's drops (`dropHeight`), which land every
  DROP_EVERY steps with a splash.
  **Again on #186's deploy (5831ff7, 2026-09-27 12:34Z), where it stopped the
  deploy:** A 234 against B 81, 0.35, the mirrors clear (0/0/0 and 2/0/0), the
  fingers 0.0 cells from where they were picked; the same shard passed on all four
  of #186's own runs. It is not one finger: the first time A was the low one, this
  time B. With two failures now at 0.34–0.35 and nine to thirteen
  passes at 0.63–0.99, the split is bimodal, which reads like one finger's drops
  landing a beat later than the other's in the window, not noise round a mean.
  **A third time on #196 (ed42edd, 2026-09-27 16:04Z)**, a desk-only change: A 81
  against B 221, 0.37, the mirrors clear, 0.0 cells of drift, 100 readbacks. The
  three low fingers read 62, 81 and 81 and the high ones 181 to 234: one finger
  laying about one drop's dye and the other about three, where a phase difference
  between the two fingers' drop clocks (each counts DROP_EVERY solver steps from its
  own touch) can only make them one drop apart. So look at what can take a whole
  drop away: a drop's splash (`autoInject('drop')`) carried out of the measuring
  disk, or two drops on one spot capped at the plate's density ceiling.
  (#186 changed where a press lands; the held Drop's splash lands on whole cells
  already, so it lays the same as before.)
  **A fourth time on #208 (3a0fcf8, 2026-09-28): A 201 against B 65, 0.32.** Read
  2026-10-03 against the 35 other Mac runs of the last two days: that one red, and
  the pairs that passed read 0.46 to 0.98 of each other, at 74 to 269 a finger, both
  fingers 52 cells from the middle every time. Classic lays the Drop as a stream
  (Drop Height 0), not drops, so the drop-clock theory above was not this check's:
  both fingers lay on every step from the second touch to the lift, by the code. So
  the check is now two, and the next red says which half: **what each finger laid**,
  by the app's own count (`chromaglassDebug().hands()[i].laid`: steps held, drops,
  dye handed the solver; each held to the steps the plate itself took with it down,
  and the same dye a step for both), and **what the plate holds**, the dye under
  each finger against its mirrors as before, at least a fifth of its nearest dye
  still inside its disk, with the balance asked of the dye nearest each finger
  (within three disks, nearer it than the other) instead of one disk, so a pool the
  plate carried off its finger's cell in the 1.9 s is still counted as that finger's.
  *Still open:* why the plate's two pools of the same steps differ by up to 2.5
  times on a cleared plate. The line now prints the disk and the nearest-dye readings
  side by side, so a red with equal counts and unequal nearest dye is the plate
  losing one pool's dye, and equal nearest dye with unequal disks is the plate
  moving it. Both halves were shown red on the Mac before merging, each on a mutant
  pushed to the PR and reverted. With B's dye reaching the plate at a third, the
  plate half went red (A 194, B 72, 0.37) while the count half stayed green (A 28
  steps and 222 dye, B 26 and 206, against the plate's 26 to 30 steps), as it
  should, since both fingers had laid alike. With B laying on every other step, the
  count half went red (A 23 steps, B 11, against the plate's 21 to 25), and the
  plate half stayed green at A 101 to B 61 (0.60). A half-rate finger is inside
  the plate's own scatter, so the plate's balance could never have caught it. On
  both runs, the dye nearest each finger equalled the dye in its disk, so in these
  1.9 s the plate does not carry a pool off its finger. A red with equal counts is
  therefore dye the plate lost, not dye it moved.
  **Found 2026-10-04 (#240): the plate lost it to the fingering push, which #222
  took out.** Of the six reds handed over as this line's (2026-10-03), two were the
  mutants above, run on purpose on #224's branch (commits 7efc16a and 81748e9 say
  so), not flakes. Three more, one finger at a third with both counts equal (main's
  deploys at 05:11Z, A 69 to B 229, and 06:06Z, A 236 to B 84; Roy's branch at
  07:57Z, A 197 to B 72), and the four of 2026-09-27/28 above, all ran on trees
  before #222 merged (08:38Z 2026-10-03). In the 80-odd Mac runs of the phone's
  fingers since, none has read one finger low, and four diagnostic runs on the Mac
  (PR #240, taken out again) held two Drops 146 times, most with the band playing, after
  the Press as the check does and not, with every readback fresh (landed within two
  of issued) and no drying, thinning, air or multiply near the fingers: none did
  either. The push moved dye up its own gradient where its noise was negative, a
  held pool is the steepest gradient on the plate, and the advection's hold and cap
  threw away what it piled up; where the noise was positive the pool kept its dye,
  so which finger lost hung on where the plate's angle put it, and when.
  `npm run grating` §6 replays two held Drops (Water, 7.9 a step, as the red lines
  print) at two red runs' cells on the phone's grid, at ten moments of the show's
  clock: with the push back the pools read 82 to 238 of 237 laid, a pair as
  uneven as 94 to 235 (0.40), four of twenty under 0.6; as it is, every pool keeps
  191 or 192, the pairs 1.00 of each other. *Still open, and rarer:* both fingers low at once, after
  #222. Once on #230's branch (16:07Z 2026-10-03, A 0 and B 0 with 214 and 206
  laid, the mirrors at -0 to -3) and once in the 146 holds (74 and 76 of 285 and
  277, the whole plate up 159 of 562 laid, low from the first reading 0.4 s in,
  in the one diagnostic run that did not yet log drying or air). Not stale
  readbacks; not seen in the few holds with the band never started, too few to
  clear the band. The line now prints the whole plate's gain against what both
  fingers handed it, so the next one says whether the plate lost dye everywhere.
- **Found while reading it, and fixed with it: a held Drop with Drop Height up let
  go of a drop on every step, not every tenth.** Its clock (`dropClockRef`, and each
  finger's own) was counted up only past a frame's first step until it had started,
  so on frames of one step each, a plate stepping at the display's rate, it stayed
  at 0 and every step was a drop: 60 drops in 60 steps where 6 were meant, 33 with
  one two-step frame among them (simulated over the old and new counting); ten times
  the dye and a splash on every step until the first frame that happened to owe two.
  Counted after each step it is used on, the first step is still a drop at once.
  `npm run phone` counts a held finger's drops against its steps on the Mac shard.
  It cannot show the old clock there: the Mac runner's phone section steps
  less than once a frame (14 to 18 steps over 15 to 20 frames). That makes two-step
  frames common, which unstuck the old clock, so the old clock passed too (2 drops
  over 16 steps). The arithmetic above is the evidence for the fix, and the owner's
  look at Bass Drop and Boiling Point at 60 fps is the check (`docs/judging.md` §19).
- `tools.mjs`, "Blow held still blows a bubble": the straw blew 0 bubbles, on the
  run after, where every other shard passed.
- `npm run startup`, the same check, a second kind of stop: on #186's run on 1f627f3
  (2026-09-27) the frames stopped 2.22 s from 1.34 s, *before* the device was given
  (asked at 0.53 s, given at 3.50 s; the first step at 13.61 s), where the check
  names the stop at the GPU's start as a separate 0.30 s from 1.04 s. The same app
  passed the shard on the commit before (40dee25; only a check script differed).
  Not #181's stop (that one sat a quarter second after the first step). Worth
  measuring what the page does while Chromium creates the device (the table shows
  no frames counted between 0.77 s and 3.48 s), and whether 4b should own every
  stop before the device is given rather than only the first. Again on #194's run
  on 5fd3636 (2026-09-27): 3.52 s from 1.04 s, the device asked at 0.83 s and given
  at 4.56 s, while the control's stop at the GPU's start began at 1.43 s, so the
  check's 0.25 s match to it missed and the stop counted as an opening stop. #194
  changes nothing that runs before the device is given (its ladder is built once a
  device and a stage exist); 5fd3636's parent 1d842d1 passed the same shard.
  **Fixed (this PR):** the moment a stop begins is not what makes it Chromium's.
  Over 53 open-shard logs of 26-27 September, every opening (the control's and the
  show's) drew no frame for 1.25 to 4.2 s from about 1.0 to 1.4 s after load, and in
  every one whose timeline was printed the page's own timers stopped with the frames
  and no long task of the page's lay in it: Chromium holds the page's whole thread
  while it starts its GPU, and lets go within a tenth of a second of handing over the
  adapter or device. The show's own stops leave the page's timers running (the nine
  second freeze #164 fixed; the stop after the first step #181 fixed). #204's red (run
  36346188828) was the old rule's matching: a 0.15 s long task let one frame through
  at 1.41 s, the rule matched that sliver and the 2.58 s rest went to check 4. Now a
  tick every 100 ms marks the page's thread; any stretch of half a second or more,
  beginning in the first 3 s and ending before the first step, with no frame, no
  tick and no long task, and not begun where a promise the page awaits had just
  settled, is time the thread was held from outside, taken out of check 4's frame
  gaps and held by 4b to 4.5 s all told. If long tasks cannot be seen or the timer
  runs slow, nothing is taken out. The settled promises are there because the
  check-skeptic review found that the page's own JavaScript run after an `await` on
  a WebGPU promise (all the show's GPU setup) is never a long task: a second of it
  looked exactly like a held thread. Long animation frames were tried first and
  fail on the Mac: Chromium's own hold was one too (2.94 s from 1.01 s, run
  36353565837). What does tell is that the page's code after an await begins the
  moment its promise settles, and Chromium's hold begins with the adapter or device
  still pending. In a cloud session (`ci-flakes/startup-lab/probe7.mjs`) a second
  of busy code after awaiting requestDevice, a pipeline, fetch and work done each
  read as the page's own, and a renderer stopped from outside for 2 s read as held.
  *Still open:* a continuation of something the check does not wrap (an `import()`)
  would look held; the 4.5 s cap is the backstop. The long animation frames stay
  printed with where their rendering began, in case they can tell later. On this
  PR's green run (36364179427) the show's hold at the GPU's start, a 2.08 s frame
  gap that check 4 alone would have failed, was taken out as held (2.05 s). *Open:*
  the control's hold on the same run (3.82 s from 1.05 s, inside its device
  request) read neither held nor the page's own; the control is not judged, and a
  miss there can only make the show red, never pass it, but the opening line now
  prints what 4b made of each page's wait so the next runs say why. *Answered by 14v-5 (2026-10-10): the intro turning while the GPU started; it now starts still.* Seen on #299 and #301, 2026-10-05: a third kind, frames stopped with the page's timer still running, inside the device request: #301's run 37355609842 stopped 2.07 s from 2.57 s, the device asked at 2.39 s and given at 4.71 s, a long animation frame from 2.58 s whose rendering began at 4.65 s with no script in it, and #299's earlier head 2.20 s the same way. Again on #330's run 38028974928 (2026-10-10): 2.17 s from 2.76 s, the device asked at 2.40 s and given at 5.03 s, no long task, nothing made or written in the gap; #330 changes nothing before the device either. Not held (the timer ran) and not the page's own (nothing of its ran); check 4 counts it. Neither PR runs anything before the device is given. Whether 4b should own a frame stop that lies wholly inside a pending requestDevice with no page script in its long animation frame is the question. The old "within 0.25 s of the control's stop" and "control plus a second" are
  gone. Read against the 53 logs: #204's red and 36339282520's split stop (1.28 s
  then 1.68 s) now count as one held stretch each, 2.57 s and about 3 s; 2 of the 53
  (4.05 s on 36294600123, 3.75 s on 36338802046, each wholly inside a four-second
  device request) went over the old 3.5 s cap, as did #194's 3.52 s; the owner chose
  to raise it to 4.5 s, above every opening read (the controls' longest 4.18 s).
- `npm run startup`, 1b, "moving for good no later than the old way" (with 3 s to
  spare): red on three of seventy open-shard runs, 27 September to 3 October (16.72
  against 13.71 s on 36371919138, 22.47 against 18.12 on 37095698733, 19.24 against
  14.99 on #223's 37143242070), while the show less the control ran -4.95 to +4.35 s
  across them. One opening against one, unpaired, measured the runner: each wait is
  Chromium handing over the GPU (2.9 to 6.1 s after load), the GPU compiling the same
  forty-five pipelines cold, and the page's own work, and the compile took the two
  openings of one run 0.75 to 1.5 times as long a pipeline as each other (the three
  reds 1.22 to 1.31, 12.9 to 16.8 s of compile in the show). **Fixed (this PR):** 1b
  takes Chromium's handover and the compile of the old way's pipelines out of both
  sides, and holds what is left, the page's own wait (beyond-the-list builds in it),
  to the control's plus 1 s: replayed on all seventy, -0.89 to +0.27 s, the three reds
  +0.01, +0.27 and +0.07. A second line holds the show's build of those pipelines to
  1.75 times the control's stop for them, so a slower way of building still reads
  red. *Still open:* the replay approximated each build from the run's total (the
  logs printed only that); the first green Mac runs print the real split, and the
  1.75 should be read against twenty of them. **Fixed again (the next PR):** the
  first cut read the old way's compile off the stop in its steps, and went red on
  #218's deploy (37167643240) the first time a control's frames stopped (2.16 to
  19.78 s) before its first step was counted: no stop in its steps, so nothing
  priced. It now reads the stop in its frames that its on-frame builds sat in (begun
  within a second of the last, counted from the end of Chromium's requests to the
  frames' return); replayed on the seventy as a proxy, -0.90 to +0.31 s (sd 0.22),
  and that deploy's control about 2.0 s against the show's 1.14 s. Each run now
  prints every stop its control's frames made, what was built in each and which it
  priced. Its first Mac run (37171671783) showed why it sums the stops a build sat
  in, each less Chromium's part, rather than taking the first: the control's frames
  stopped through the device's handover with its first build in that stop, then
  from 4.76 s for 12.10 s for the other 47, and the first, less Chromium's, read
  0.01 s (917x). On that run's numbers it reads 12.10 s, the show's own 1.05 s
  against 1.86 s and its build 1.03x. A stop with no build in it is never priced,
  so a runner's stall among the builds cannot make the 1.75x bound lenient. A build less than half again slower
  than the runner's own spread cannot be told from it by one pair of openings; a
  third opening, or a reference compile timed inside each, would cost another
  half-minute of Mac time a run.
- Still owed from that hunt: the solver's first submits cost a few tenths of a second
  more than later ones even with every compute pipeline dispatched once ahead on
  scraps (downsample 0.32 s, upsampleDelta 0.40 s, run 36306162647). Worth finding
  whether a one-workgroup dispatch on one-texel scraps reaches the cost at all.
- `tools.mjs`, the Finger's "and adds none": red on 4 of about 20 Mac runs across
  four branches on 2026-09-27 (53 → 66, 56 → 71, 50 → 64, 49 → 64, where the plate
  left alone drifted −22 to −12 before and +8 to +10 after), green on the rest,
  including gains as large (61 → 81 against +1 and +8). What differs on the red runs is
  the drift before the stroke, negative every time, so the margin read off it looks
  like the thing to read first; nothing measured yet says why.
- `magnet.mjs`, "dragging the Magnet gathers the ferrofluid along where the hand
  goes": on #180 (PLAN.md only, the same code #179's PR and deploy passed), the drag
  gathered 300 → 363 against 266 → 300 left alone, a gain of 29 where the check asks
  a tenth of 300. It asks the gain against what was there, on a hand path drawn at
  random each run, so a run whose best spot starts full reads low; worth reading
  the gain's spread over the last runs before touching its tenth.
- `phone.mjs`, "portrait: set to one bar in the drawer, the same take lands in about
  half the time": on #210 (the Press; no mixer or phone code) it landed where it
  should (0 at 1944 ms against two bars' 3849 ms; #201's run 1936 against 3838) and
  went red on "with a jump", whose size the line did not print (it does now). The fade is stepped by
  a 16 ms show interval against the show clock and the slider shows React's state,
  so a main thread that stalls on a busy Mac runner moves the level a stall's worth
  at once, and at one bar the allowance per 80 ms sample (0.106) is half two bars'.
  Worth printing the largest step and its gap first, then asking whether the walk
  should stamp the level with the show's time rather than the harness's.
