# 7. The room in the plate: the camera as a sensor: what shipped

How §7's shipped items were found, built and measured. The open work is in
[`docs/plan/07-room-camera.md`](../plan/07-room-camera.md), where each keeps a one-line stub naming
its id here. The stories moved out of the plan in four passes and stand under them in
that order (what each pass took is in [README.md](README.md)).

## First pass (moved 2026-10-04)

### 7. The room in the plate: the camera as a sensor

`src/lib/sceneSense.ts` (new), `src/hooks/useSceneCamera.ts` (new),
`src/components/LiquidVisualizer.tsx`, `src/types.ts`, `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx`,
`src/lib/midi.ts`

The camera is already open and already on screen: `startFilmCamera` runs `getUserMedia`
and the frame loop uploads each frame to the film texture, where `filmMix` shows it
through the dye. It is a slide in a projector. Nothing ever reads it back, so the room
in front of the plate cannot touch the liquid.

Reading it back is cheap, and both ports it would drive already exist. `applyGesture`
is how every hand reaches the plate — mouse, pen, phone pad, gamepad, OSC, replay — so
anything that can name a tool, a point and a direction is a projectionist. And with the
GPU solver attached the CPU arrays are per-frame *delta* buffers, flushed as
`applyDeltas`, so a whole velocity field written with `addVelocity` lands on both
engines with no new shader and no new upload path. The work is three small pieces and
one piece of taste.

Independent of batches 1–4 and of 6, so it can be built while the Mac is judging a
look.

**Sensing** (`sceneSense.ts`, pure: pixels in, a reading out, no DOM and no GPU, so
it can be measured without a browser). The video is drawn to a 96² canvas and read
back as luma. From two consecutive frames:

- a **flow lattice**, Lucas–Kanade per cell on a 24² lattice: one pass over the pixels
  accumulating the structure tensor, not a block search, so the cost is the frame and
  not the search radius. Sub-pixel, and regularised so a blank wall reads as still
  rather than as noise.
- a **presence mask** from a background model that creeps toward the frame at a fixed
  step per second — a running median in everything but name, which survives a slow
  light change and holds a person who stops moving.
- **global scalars**: motion energy, its centroid and dominant direction, how spread
  out it is, people count, scene brightness, the scene's colour centroid.

Energy is **normalised against the room's own recent range**, the way `autoCalibrate`
does for the microphone, because a dark venue with a strobe and a lit rehearsal room
are four orders of magnitude apart and no fixed threshold serves both.

**The room stirs the plate** (`sceneDrive`). The lattice is bilinearly upsampled to the
sim grid and added as velocity each frame. One loop. This is the piece
that delivers the idea, and it is the smallest of the three.

**People as hands** (`sceneHands`). Connected components on the presence mask, the
largest few kept, matched to last frame's tracks by nearest centroid so each person
carries a **stable id**. Each track calls `applyGesture`: still → `press`, a palm on
the glass, so the beat squeeze works on it; moving → `blow` along its velocity;
arriving → `drop`. Everything downstream — bubbles, beads, the squeeze film — reacts
without knowing where the hand came from.

The id is what makes it a show rather than a stirred plate: hashed into the preset's
**palette contract**, so a person gets a dye that is stable across the set and still
inside the dyes the preset may use. One dancer is always the magenta, and the magenta
goes where they go.

**Assigning it to anything else** (`sceneMappings`, `sceneImpact`). The audio already
has the right shape for this: a feature, a target and a depth. The scene gets the same
vocabulary — motion, presence, spread, centroid, people, brightness, scene hue — and a
list of mappings onto any learnable setting, with one master depth over the lot. A room
filling up can open the palette; a crowd going still can drop the turbulence; someone
walking left to right can ride the lamp across the plate. None of it hardcoded.

**Gates.** Batch 7a: a reading at 20 Hz for under 2 ms on the main thread, and a
sensor preview that makes the camera aimable in a dark room. 7b: a hand waved at 3 m in
a lit room visibly moves the dye within 200 ms, and pointing the camera at the
projection screen does not run away. 7c: a person tracked across the frame keeps one id
and one dye for 30 s of ordinary movement.

**Risks.**

- **The feedback loop.** A camera that can see the projection screen makes the plate
  drive itself. Two guards were tried and the harness threw both out. Subtracting the
  steady part of the flow field removes 0 % of a pattern that *travels*, which is what
  a loop looks like. Comparing the room's flow against the plate's own velocity —
  the loop being the plate seen through a lens — scored a fan in the corner of the
  frame *higher* than a real loop: from one camera the two are not distinguishable,
  because a driven plate moves the way the room moved. What holds it is the per-cell
  cap against the solver's damping, which makes the loop saturate rather than diverge:
  measured over forty closed-loop seconds it settles at 0.26, about what one wave of an
  arm peaks at, and climbs 1.04x over its last third. So a mis-aimed camera is a plate
  stirred by nothing in particular, not a show that has to be restarted — and aiming it
  away from the screen is still the instruction, not an optimisation.
- **Latency.** Capture to analysis is 50–100 ms. Right for *the room stirs the liquid*,
  wrong for anything expected to land on a beat — discrete hits stay on the beat clock.
- **The venue.** Strobes, auto-exposure pumping and rolling shutter all read as
  whole-frame motion. The running normalisation and a deadzone absorb the slow part;
  the fast part is why the flow is median-ish per cell rather than a frame mean.
- **The frame budget.** Analysis runs throttled and its cost is reported, so if it ever
  needs a worker the move is a buffer transfer rather than a rewrite. Until then the
  governor sees it as frame time and drops a rung rather than dropping frames.
- **Two apps, one camera.** A laptop will often not give the browser a device OBS
  already holds; the sensor names the device it opened and says so when it cannot.

**Privacy.** A camera pointed at a crowd is not a feature to be quiet about. Frames are
analysed in the page and never leave it, nothing is recorded, and the panel says so
where the camera is switched on.
