# 6. Render a song: what shipped

How §6's shipped items were found, built and measured. The open work is in
[`docs/plan/06-render-a-song.md`](../plan/06-render-a-song.md), where each keeps a one-line stub naming
its id here. The stories moved out of the plan in four passes and stand under them in
that order (what each pass took is in [README.md](README.md)).

## First pass (moved 2026-10-04)

### 6. Render a song

`src/lib/rng.ts` (new), `src/lib/render.ts` (new), `src/hooks/useRecorder.ts`,
`src/lib/songMap.ts`, `src/lib/sequencer.ts`

This is the batch that changes what ChromaGlass is.

Recording today is `MediaRecorder` on the canvas: it captures whatever reached the
screen, drops frames whenever the machine is busy, and gives back a WebM whose timing
follows the render loop's bad luck. The reference tool does the opposite and is right
to: it steps the effect frame by frame, pre-analyses the loaded audio with an offline
FFT so the reactivity is identical on every run, encodes with WebCodecs and muxes to
MP4 with the audio track, up to 4K and ten minutes, streaming to disk rather than
holding the clip in memory.

We can go past that, because we have the pieces it has no equivalent for: song
identification, song maps, presets saved for a song and sequences with cue sheets. A
**Render this song** that plays the sequence deterministically, at a grid the live
machine cannot hold (768² or 1024²), with every solver step computed rather than every
displayed frame captured, produces a finished light-show film of that song. Not a
screen recording of a performance: the performance itself, run again at full quality.
Nobody else in this space ships that.

- **Seeded randomness.** There are 104 `Math.random` calls in the solver, the beads,
  the bubbles and the macro camera. Every one becomes a draw from a seeded generator
  carried on the fluid, or the same song rendered twice is two different films. This is
  the bulk of the work.
- **Offline audio analysis.** Bands and onsets pre-computed per frame from the song
  file, so the reactivity is fixed to the timeline rather than to the frame rate, and a
  render at 60 fps matches a render at 30.
- **WebCodecs encode to MP4** with the audio track, streaming to disk. Chrome only; on
  other browsers the current `MediaRecorder` capture stays as the fallback and says so.
- **Runs the show, not the settings.** A sequence, a per-song preset and the cue sheet
  play out over the song's real timeline.

**Gate:** the same song rendered twice is byte-identical, and a 3-minute 1080p render
completes without dropping a frame.

**Shipped, the first half of the gate met.** Seeded randomness in #153
(`src/lib/rng.ts`, one seed a load, `?seed=` fixes it, 199 `Math.random` references on
the plate down to 5 allowlisted; `npm run seed`). Offline bands and onsets in #154. The
render in #156: a film button in the music player steps the plate on a fixed clock
(`src/lib/showClock.ts`) and muxes MP4 or WebM with the song, in-house
(`npm run render` 105/105, ffprobe agreeing). On Metal, `npm run render-app` reads
24/24: the same seed twice draws the same 240 frames and an 8 s film lasts 8000.0 ms.
**Not yet measured:** a 3-minute 1080p render end to end, and a full sequence with its
cue sheet played out over a song. Both need the Mac.

One caution from batch 10's step 0: a fixed seed makes a *render* repeat, but not a
live take. Two Metal runs of the same code on the same seeds read Classic's motion
half-life as 1.0 s and then 11.3 s, because a live take's frames depend on the frame
clock. Judge a live-motion change by its range leaving the old range, not by a median
moving.

*Proposed 2026-09-28:* **record the whole set, render it afterwards.** A take today is
the gestures painted with the laptop's primary pointer, at about 15 Hz
(`performanceTake.ts`; "Feed the performance recorder" in `LiquidVisualizer.tsx`): no
settings, no Go or Back, no Mixer takes, blackout or tempo, and no phone, OSC or
gamepad hands. Log all of it with the seed, write the audio to disk as it plays, and
afterwards render the set through the existing Render path at 1080p or 4K. As the
caution above says, it would be the same decisions, not the same pixels. The phone's
hands already go through `performGesture`, so they are logged with the rest, and its
Record toggle arms "log the set". *Measure:* `npm run render` of a logged two-minute
set holds the live log's Go times and look names.
