# 2. Lacing: what shipped

How §2's shipped items were found, built and measured. The open work is in
[`docs/plan/02-lacing.md`](../plan/02-lacing.md), where each keeps a one-line stub naming
its id here. The stories moved out of the plan in four passes and stand under them in
that order (what each pass took is in [README.md](README.md)).

## First pass (moved 2026-10-04)

### 2. Lacing

`src/components/LiquidVisualizer.tsx` (fragment shader)

The pale hair-thin filaments that outline every colour boundary in a pour. Driven by
the strain rate at the interface (the velocity gradient projected along the dye
gradient, both already available in the shader when the velocity texture is bound),
not drawn as a fixed edge, so it thins where the boundary is stretched and thickens
where it folds. New setting `lacing`; the existing `macroLacing` stays as the macro
camera's own.

**Gate:** structure at 4 px ≥ 0.9 % and at 8 px ≥ 1.2 % on a crop inside the plate
(batch 1 left these at 0.3 % and 0.5 %, against a filmed pour's 1.5 % and 2.3 %).
**Depends on** batch 1: lacing a smeared boundary looks like a glow, not a filament.

**Shipped, and the gate only half met.** On a seeded Fillmore plate, grain and cells off,
a 380 px crop inside the dish: pixels on a hard edge 6.5 % → 8.5 % at the default and
13.8 % at full, and typical local contrast 3.2 → 4.6 → 5.8, which puts both inside the
filmed references' band (4.2–7.3 % and 2.0–7.2). Structure at 4 px moved 0.4 % → 0.5 % →
0.7 % and at 8 px 0.4 % → 0.5 % → 0.7 %, so the mid-scale half of the gate is **not met**.

That is the honest reading rather than a tuning failure: filaments are a boundary
decoration, and 4–8 px variance is *composition* — drops, cells, the size range within a
cluster. The reference frames carry theirs in their drops and their cell networks, which
is batch 3. The gate moves there: **4 px ≥ 0.9 % and 8 px ≥ 1.2 % after batch 3**, with
lacing judged on what it is, which is the edge and contrast numbers above.
